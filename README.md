# RecyclerViewPlayground
Sample project created to reduce the boilerplate code involved in the creation of a recycler view. Let's go to try different libraries to achieve this!

## Samples created in this project:
I have created a sample to show a video items list, inspired by the sample
used in [Renderers library](https://github.com/pedrovgs/Renderers)

The video list is hardcoded in a json file, with data from [thetvdb](http://thetvdb.com/)

I have implemented the same sample with different libraries:
- `No libraries`: Recycler view implemented in the traditional way. This sample doesn't use any external library to avoid boilerplate code.
- `Epoxy`: Recycler view implemented with [Epoxy library](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy)
- `Renderers`: Recycler view implemented with [Renderers library](https://github.com/pedrovgs/Renderers)
- `Groupie`: Recycler view implemented with [Groupie library](https://github.com/Genius/groupie)

## Which library is the best?
The best library is the one that best fits your requirements. Just read documentation of different libraries,
checkout this project, checkout library projects and make your choice!

## TODO List
Add more complicated samples to see the power of all libraries
